# Hello-world
Learning to do repository and GitHub
I am 38 and a single mom to two boys ages 9 and 15. On top of trying to enroll in this course, I am also in the second year of my bachelors degree and majoring in Criminal Justice with concentration in criminology. Ironically, I do not wish to be in the criminal justice field. I want to pursue psychology. I have two dogs as well. Their names are Pax and Bellum. They are latin words meaning Peace and War. In my free time I love reading, painting, and doing anything outdoors with my kids as well as attending their sporting events.
